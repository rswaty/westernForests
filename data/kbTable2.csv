MAP,PRO,CON
TreeMap FIA,Dominant species identified (except mixed con), To what extent is error in LF inherited in Tree Map?
,Clear relationship to a plot,Doesn’t distinguish wet vs. dry Doug-fir
,Advantages for calculating C?,Maps eastern types in the west
LF SAF,Dominant species identified (except in mixed con),Not independently mapped
LF EVT,Lumping up allows us to pull out types we want and improves accuracy,Can’t identify dominant species
,No x-walk needed,EVTs may not link well to literature
,Distinguishes dry vs. mesic mixed conifer,
